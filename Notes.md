# Notes

- In Go, it is generally recommended to use lowercase, hyphen-seperated names for directories, packages, and modules. Using spaces or uppercase letters may cause package discovery and imports. I was getting a warning that the file is not within module ".". This was resolved when I updated the folder structure and named the folders properly.
